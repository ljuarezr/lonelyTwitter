Test driven development

Need to test a class:
-right click on the class
-Go To> test> Create new test
-use JUnit3

1. write tests that fail
2. write code for the tests
3. run the tests and go to 2 until they pass
4. goto 1

** all tests functions begin with the prefix test-
-Java doesn't run the tests in order, so dont make 
them dependent on each other.
-avoid using setup and teardown 

We want to pretend that, when we wite the tests, we 
already have all of the reqs we need. (rather than 
having the other classes empty).

The simpler the code inside of the tests, the easier 
it is to check what function failed.


==> To run a method test, right click on the name of 
the method > Run Test
